<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**Note**: Project is still in development!

### Built With

This section lists any major frameworks and methodologies that I used to build my project.

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* Flexbox
* Mobile-first 
* Semantic HTML5 markup


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation and Setup

Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.  

Installation:

`npm install`  

To Start Server:

`npm start`  

To Visit App:

`localhost:3000`  


### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Reflection

  <!-- - This is a side project to test out my skills.
  - P.S I love building this!
  - Initially I was planning on building this with Context API, however after a while it became so cumbersome that I ended up with some spaghetti code and decided to hard reset to my previous commit. The reason I decided to go with Context API is because I thought Redux would be an overkill for this small app and it gets quite repetitive with creating constants, acitions, reducers, combining reducers etc. Fortunately, I found out about an amazing third-party app, built by the Redux team, called Redux Toolkit which is in my opinion very elegant and helps you write very clean code. In just 20 minutes I got the hang of it and I feel like I just won the lottery today. I love it!
  - P.S by hour 8 I was wondering why my custom component is not rendering and after careful debugging, I saw I wasn't returning it from my map function... this is when I knew I needed a break  -->

### Goals:  

I have spent a total of 35 hours building this project.
