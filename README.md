## Reflection

  - This is the main project that I am working on that is helping me cement my skills.
  - P.S I love building this!
  - So far I have not encountered any huge issues or challenges. It took some time to figure out how to warp text around an object though, sheesh...
  - Tools used:
      - I love using both React and SASS. They make everything so much easier to structure, organize, refactor, troubleshoot and generally work with. The combination saves you a lot of time. 

#### Goals:  

I have spent a total of 21 hours building this project.

One of the goals for this website is to implement an arcade game which I am absolutely looking forward to. I also want to implement some features with particleJS and add some animated carachters.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
